# PAIN Log — Code-Production Friction

Running record of friction points encountered during development.
Each item has a **severity** (blocks work / slows / annoys), a **symptom**, and a **candidate fix**.
Address these in dedicated review sessions, not inline during feature work.

**Convention:** when an item is fixed, cut it from this file and paste it into `docs/PAIN-archive.md`
in the same commit as the fix. This file holds OPEN items only, severity-sorted.

## P3 — `sort-keys` lint rule on handler objects (severity: annoys)

**Symptom.** `Toolkit.of({...})` and any multi-key object literal requires alphabetically sorted
keys. Easy to add a new tool handler in the "logical" order (read → write → run) rather than
lexicographic order; discovered only on `pnpm lint`.

**Encountered in.** `GeorgesToolkit.ts` after adding `run-script` after `write-workspace`.

**Candidate fix.** Enable `sort-keys` in `oxlint-autofix.sh` so the lefthook pre-commit pass
corrects it automatically instead of blocking. Check oxlint docs for `--fix` support on
`sort-keys`.

## P6 — `replace_all: true` blast radius on Edit tool (severity: blocks work)

**Symptom.** A broad `replace_all: true` substitution (e.g., `err` → `error`) silently corrupts
unrelated identifiers (`console.error` → `console.erroror`). Requires reading the entire file
after every broad edit to catch collisions.

**Encountered in.** `packages/host/src/main.ts` during `catch-error-name` lint fix.

**Candidate fix.** Avoid `replace_all: true` on short tokens. Prefer targeted single-occurrence
edits or use regex-aware replacement only when the pattern is unambiguous. For lint autofixes,
let `oxlint-autofix.sh` do the rename rather than doing it manually.
