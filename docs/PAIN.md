# PAIN Log — Code-Production Friction

Running record of friction points encountered during development.
Each item has a **severity** (blocks work / slows / annoys), a **symptom**, and a **candidate fix**.
Address these in dedicated review sessions, not inline during feature work.

**Convention:** when an item is fixed, cut it from this file and paste it into `docs/PAIN-archive.md`
in the same commit as the fix. This file holds OPEN items only, severity-sorted.

<!-- Hunt log 2026-05-15 (third pass)
Triggers that fired: explicit /hunt invocation
Hunt start time: 23:45

Candidates:
  1. Target: tsgo-effect-check.sh grep-whole-file policy → every edit to main.ts / SqliteEventStore.ts
     raises false-positive suppression block (pre-existing legitimate directives)
     | Heuristic: #7 asymmetric feedback + #1 detection-stage drift (check became noise, ignored)
     | Output channel: .claude/hooks/tsgo-effect-check.sh (switched to git diff added-lines only)
     | Bonus: SqliteEventStore.ts schemaSyncInEffect:off suppressions replaced with better-sqlite3
       generic typing — suppressions eliminated rather than whitelisted
  2. Target: No .claude/patterns/schema-decode.md — three-way decode API decision (decodeUnknownEffect /
     decodeUnknownResult / decodeUnknownSync) re-derived each session; this session cost 3 typecheck
     cycles to discover the correct API
     | Heuristic: #5 pattern absence
     | Output channel: .claude/patterns/schema-decode.md (new pattern file)
  3. Target: Law test coverage at 28% (13/39 laws) — pnpm loop:health L3 ⚠ signal; L0.x laws
     (including L0.1 "every law has a test") have zero coverage
     | Heuristic: #9 meta-loop health
     | Output channel: docs/PAIN.md (new item P28; fix > 30 min)

Stopped because: 3 candidates surfaced and landed.
All three resolved: hook fixed inline, pattern created, PAIN item filed as P28.

<!-- Hunt log 2026-05-15 (second pass)
Triggers that fired: explicit /hunt invocation
Hunt start time: 17:20

Candidates:
  1. Target: loop-health.sh — grep -c double-output arithmetic errors + [in-progress] blind spot
     | Heuristic: #9 meta-loop + #6 stale | Output channel: scripts/loop-health.sh (fixed inline)
  2. Target: CLAUDE.md rituals reference [todo] only — misses in-progress item 4.3
     | Heuristic: #6 stale doc + #8 priming | Output channel: CLAUDE.md (2 lines updated)
  3. Target: check-test-conventions.ts runs only in CI — test naming violation invisible until PR
     | Heuristic: #1 detection-stage drift | Output channel: lefthook.yml (conventions step at pre-push)

Stopped because: 3 candidates surfaced and mechanized.
All resolved in commit 24a1c979. No open PAIN items added.

<!-- Hunt log 2026-05-15
Triggers that fired: explicit /hunt invocation
Hunt start time: 17:10

Candidates:
  1. Target: oxlint-check.sh PostToolUse uses root config for frontend files → design-system plugin silently skipped at edit time
     | Heuristic: #1 detection-stage drift | Output channel: .claude/hooks/oxlint-check.sh (fixed inline)
  2. Target: session-context.sh grep [todo] misses [in-progress] items → TODO 4.3 invisible to session hook
     | Heuristic: #6/#8 stale doc + priming | Output channel: .claude/hooks/session-context.sh (fixed inline)
  3. Target: design-system rule extension cycle applied 3× with no pattern reference
     | Heuristic: #5 pattern absence | Output channel: .claude/patterns/frontend-design-system.md (new file)

Stopped because: 3 candidates surfaced and mechanized.
All three findings resolved in commit 5030e00c — no open PAIN items added.

## P44 — `POST /api/login` has no rate limiting (brute-force possible)

**Severity:** slows (security gap before external deployment)

**Symptom:** `POST /api/login` in `main.ts` has no throttle, delay, or account-lockout after
failed attempts. `scryptSync` slows each individual check (~100 ms) but does not prevent parallel
brute-force. For the prototype this is acceptable, but it blocks any external deployment.

**Candidate fix:** In-process per-IP attempt counter in the auth middleware (`withRole` / `login`
application service) with a configurable window and lockout threshold. Or: defer to an ingress-layer
rate limiter (nginx/Caddy). File a TODO for Phase 8 (outer observability) or Phase 11 security hardening.

**Acceptance test.** Integration test: send N+1 login attempts with wrong password and assert the
N+1th returns 429 or has a measurable delay — cite in PAIN closure.

## P45 — `archivedPainItems` always returns 0 (PAIN-archive.md not parsed)

**Severity:** annoys

**Symptom:** `EventStoreAdminQuery.metrics()` hardcodes `archivedPainItems: 0` with a TODO comment.
The backoffice metrics panel always shows 0 archived items regardless of how many have been closed.

**Candidate fix:** Add `parsePainArchiveMd` domain function (similar to `parsePainMd`); parse
`PAIN-archive.md` for FIXED items and return the count. The `AdminQueryPaths` struct already has the
slot for the archive path.

**Acceptance test.** Unit test for `parsePainArchiveMd` asserting it counts `## P…` entries that
contain a `FIXED` line — cite in PAIN closure.
